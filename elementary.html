				During my elementary days I studied at Lighthouse Christian Learning School Caloja-an Cebu. 
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;...Its a private school and of course its where how I learn how to read and write.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;...And my experience is fun and full of excitement but its also hard and challenging.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;...And you must speak english every time at school.
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;...I also have some memorable music because we are a christiann private school I hear this song everytime in school.
