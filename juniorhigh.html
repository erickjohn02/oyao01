				<p>During my junior highschool days I studied at University of Cebu Main Campus.
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;...And my experience is the same during in my elementary days.
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;...Its very tiring because I live in Minglanilla and my school is <strong>very far!</strong>
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;...This is where I start to grow both <i>mentaly and physically.</i> 
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;...This is also the were I started to like watching anime and this is the first op I like.
